# IoT network traffic classification
The project aims to enhance IoT devices security by classifying IoT network traffic into normal and abnormal activities using machine learning models, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Decision Trees.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Cleaned Weather Dataset for Uganda
](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/PQLYHP).
